# Clearly add these:

- Business/markets:
  - Five forces
- Leadership
  - Political capital
  - Framing
  - Curse of knowledge/Illusion of transparency
- Individuals:
  - EQ vs IQ vs RQ
  - Charitable interpretation
  - Reasonable man principle
  - Force multiplier (for the group)
- Organizations
  - Structure and agency
  - Bystander effect
  - Forcing function
  - Mere-exposure effect/In-group favoritism
  - Narcissism of small differences

# Possibly add later:

- Time horizon (short/medium/long/reaaaaly long views)
- Comparing probabilities / risk perspective scale
- Tyranny of small decisions
- Value of direct experience
- Ask experts (get agreement/disagreement ratio right)
- Incentives (similar to forcing function? People as probability
  distributions)
- Perverse incentives
- Signaling
- Betting vs socratic method
- Empathy gap
- Availability bias
- Edge effects/map is not the territory/casuistry
- Invariant
- elasticity (cross elasticity, complimentary goods, substitute goods)
- time preference
- false-consensus effect
- Pluralistic ignorance
