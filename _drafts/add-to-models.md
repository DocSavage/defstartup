# Clearly add these:

- Groups (organizations?)
  - Social/cultural norms (same as structure vs agency?)
  - Bystander effect
  - Pluralistic ignorance
- Management
  - Force multiplier
  - Maker vs manager schedule
- Communication
  - Framing
  - Elevator pitch (ridiculously important -- link from internal press
    release?)
- Miscommunication
  - Naive realism
  - False-consensus effect
  - Curse of knowledge
  - Illusion of transparency
  - Narcissism of small differences (bickering)
  - Mountains out of emotional molehills
- Negotiation/games
  - Minimax
  - When to treat a human as an NPC (People as probability
    distributions -- consider their incentives; separate the people
    from the problem -- be hard on the problem, soft on the people)
  - Compliance: anchoring, door in the face, foot in the door, etc.
Engineering
  - Data structures are more important than code
  - Re-editable code (Donald Knuth "bias against the fashion for reusable code")
  - Software release train

# Possibly add later:

- Time horizon (short/medium/long/reaaaaly long views)
- Comparing probabilities / risk perspective scale
- Tyranny of small decisions
- Value of direct experience
- Ask experts (get agreement/disagreement ratio right)
- Incentives (similar to forcing function? People as probability
  distributions)
- Perverse incentives
- Signaling
- Betting vs socratic method
- Empathy gap
- Availability bias
- Edge effects/map is not the territory/casuistry
- Invariant
- elasticity (cross elasticity, complimentary goods, substitute goods)
- time preference
- activation energy
- Counter-example
- Original thinking (Cached thoughts/Divergent thinking/Lateral thinking)
- Worst/Best/Average case analysis
- Deviance
