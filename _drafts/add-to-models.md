# Clearly add these:

- Hypothesis evaluation
  - Cached thoughts
- Decisions
  - Worst/Best/Average case analysis
- Business
  - Economies of scale/network effects/brand equity/first+fastest mover
- Communication
  - Framing
  - Elevator pitch (ridiculously important -- link from internal press
    release?)
- Miscommunication
  - Naive realism
  - False-consensus effect
  - Curse of knowledge
  - Illusion of transparency
  - Narcissism of small differences (bickering)
- People
  - Status
  - Charitable interpretation
  - EQ vs IQ vs RQ
  - Structure and agency (roles, natural gravitation towards patterns;
    acting the way you *think* the role requires of you, as opposed to
    actually doing what it requires; envy/pride for the role)
  - Volnurability vs weakness (works for friendship too -- most people
    don't make close friends because they're too embarrassed to reveal
    personal facts)
- Groups
  - Mere-exposure effect/In-group favoritism
  - Force multiplier
  - Maker vs manager schedule
  - Pluralistic ignorance
  - Bystander effect
  - Social/cultural norms
- Negotiation/games
  - Minimax
  - When to treat a human as an NPC
  - Compliance: anchoring, door in the face, foot in the door, etc.

# Possibly add later:

- Time horizon (short/medium/long/reaaaaly long views)
- Comparing probabilities / risk perspective scale
- Tyranny of small decisions
- Value of direct experience
- Ask experts (get agreement/disagreement ratio right)
- Incentives (similar to forcing function? People as probability
  distributions)
- Perverse incentives
- Signaling
- Betting vs socratic method
- Empathy gap
- Availability bias
- Edge effects/map is not the territory/casuistry
- Invariant
- elasticity (cross elasticity, complimentary goods, substitute goods)
- time preference
- activation energy
