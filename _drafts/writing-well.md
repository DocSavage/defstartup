title:  "Writing well"

# Paul Graham

## Mindset

- An essay begins with a question. You notice a door that's ajar, and
  you open it and walk in to see what's inside.
- Surprise the reader by telling them something they always knew deep
  inside but didn't bother to do the work to make it conscious.
- Collect surprises. It's a trainable skill. The more anomalies you've
  seen, the more easily you'll notice new ones.
- Pay attention to things you're not supposed to. If you're curious
  about something, trust your instincts. Don't believe what you're
  supposed to.
- Expressing ideas helps to form them. In a real essay you're thinking
  out loud.
- Writing something that other people will read forces you to think
  well.

## Process

- Don't plan. From paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their
  course. Real thought is full of false starts. An essay is a
  cleaned-up train of thought.
- Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.
- Aim for maximum surprise -- things you didn't know that contradict
  things you thought you knew. What surprises you?
- Ask 'why' about things that feel off (particularly if they feel off
  in a humorous way). That's where fruitful material is.

## Mechanics

- Read it out loud and fix everything that doesn't sound like
  conversation.

## Draft review

- Ask reviewers for two things: which parts bore them, and which seem
  unconvincing.
- Cut the boring bits.
- Make unconvincing bits more clear, or change what you're saying if
  you're wrong.
