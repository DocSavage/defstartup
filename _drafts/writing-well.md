title:  "Writing well"
---

# Paul Graham

- An essay begins with a question. You notice a door that's ajar, and
  you open it and walk in to see what's inside.
- Surprise the reader by telling them something they always knew deep
  inside but didn't bother to do the work to make it conscious.
- Collect surprises. It's a trainable skill. The more anomalies you've
  seen, the more easily you'll notice new ones.
- Pay attention to things you're not supposed to. If you're curious
  about something, trust your instincts. Don't believe what you're
  supposed to.
- Expressing ideas helps to form them. In a real essay you're thinking
  out loud.
- Writing something that other people will read forces you to think
  well.
- Don't plan. From paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their
  course. Real thought is full of false starts. An essay is a
  cleaned-up train of thought.
- Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.
- Aim for maximum surprise -- things you didn't know that contradict
  things you thought you knew. What surprises you?
- Ask 'why' about things that feel off. That's where fruitful material
  is.
- Read it out loud and fix everything that doesn't sound like
  conversation.
- Ask reviewers for two things: which parts bore them, and which seem
  unconvincing.
- Cut the boring bits.
- Make unconvincing bits more clear, or change what you're saying if
  you're wrong.

# George Orwell

- Tabulate your thoughts in precise and detailed ways.
- Prefer concrete to the abstract.
- The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.
- There is no such thing as keeping out of politics. All issues are
  political issues.
- Grammar is of no importance, so long as the meaning is clear.
- If you simplify your language, you are freed from the orthodoxy.
- Put off using words and get the meaning clear through pictures and
  sensations.
- Then choose -- not simply accept -- words that will conver the
  meaning.
- Pick words for the sake of their meaning and invent images to make
  the meaning clearer.
- Use arresting imagery, simple verbs, and short words.
- Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you
  are used to seeing in print.
- Never use a long word where a short one will do.
- If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
- Never use the passive where you can use the active.
- Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if
  you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
- Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright
  barbarous.
- In every sentence ask yourself: what am I trying to say? What words
  will express it? What image will make it clearer? Is this image
  fresh enough to have an effect? Could I put it more shortly? Have I
  said anything that is avoidably ugly?
